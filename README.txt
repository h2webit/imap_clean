This script allows you to analyze your imap mailbox and decide to massively delete messages from the most frequent senders.

imap_analyze.py - Analyzes the messages, counts them, divides them by sender and then asks which sender you want to delete

imap_clean.py - Only does deletion without analyzing


Replace `[username]`, `[IMAP server]`, and `[password]` with your email account's username, IMAP server address, and password, respectively.

If you prefer not to enter the password in the command line, omit `-p [password]`. The script will prompt you to enter the password securely.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to view email counts and delete messages.

## Important Notes
